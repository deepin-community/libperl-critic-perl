libperl-critic-perl (1.096-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From the upstream Changes:

  [1.094] Released on 2009-01-01

    Incompatible Changes:
    * The way that "## no critic" markers was refactored.  As
      a result, we discovered that the syntax for the markers was pretty
      vague.  If you didn't do it just right, it would disable all policies,
      and not just the specific ones that you wanted.  So we've tightened this
      up a bit.  If you followed the examples that have been in the docs for
      the last couple years, then you should be fine.  But if you've been
      using certain other variations in your "## no critic" markers, then you
      might suddenly find yourself violating the new
      ProhibtUnrestrictedNoCritic policy.  To fix this, just make sure your
      Policy names appear in parentheses:

        ## no critic Foo, Bar, Baz     # wrong!
        ## no critic Foo Bar Baz       # wrong!


        ## no critic (Foo, Bar, Baz)   # ok!
        ## no critic qw(Foo Bar Baz)   # also ok!

    * The deprecated $FORMAT variables for Perl::Critic::Policy and
      Perl::Critic::Violation no longer exist.  Use the corresponding
      get_format() and set_format() functions instead.
